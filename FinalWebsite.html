<h2> Bio </h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from Rose L. Hardy Middle School and went on to attend McKinley Technology High School for grades 9 and 10. I am currently a junior at Cesar Chavez Parkside High School.

      <p>
        Every summer I work in the Summer Youth Employment Program. I was one of about 30 applicants who were accepted to work at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as a raising 2018 Holocaust Ambassador. I completed my 14 weeks and graduated from the Bringing the Lessons Home program and I am a Holocaust Museum Ambassador for life. I also worked at the Georgetown Law School Site for Girls Who Code 2018. There, I learned more complex programming languages and worked on networking with my fellow workmates and the guest speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am 16 and the oldest of all of my siblings. I have eight sisters and one brother. I was born in Washington D.C. and I have resided here and in South Carolina.

        I like sketching and art, performing and singing, robotics, coding, writing poetry, and playing my instruments. My favorite food is Pork n’ Chive Dumplings and my least favorite food is chicken.

                Betrayal knows my name.
                I know only a one way game.
                Made of different paths.
                All going down the wrong road.
                Passageways to what is the unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                Love and hate are both strong words,
                Two of which are never applied.
                To the cruel reality of the world.
                Fairy Tales, called Tales for a reason.
                No one lives without a conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                Moon, Sun, Rain, Clouds, go away.
                Stay away, never come back until I say.
                Welcome to a world of pain.
                Where only god knows the truth.
                Hence why Betrayal Knows My Name.

                            I have no name, yet I reek of fame.
                            Only with the nerds, but maybe the goths too.
                            Everyone I know, know nothing of me.
                            I am just that kid that sits alone.
                            Like a ghost in the corner.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            For some weird reason, I can’t make a friend.
                            They jump, run, and they hide from me.
                            Happy to be in Middle School? I AM NOT!
                            My name is Destiny, but it really hurts.
                            When a kid walks up and says hi Emily.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Who do you think you are?!
                            Don’t you dare call me crazy!
                            I’m just a loner.
                            The one that sits in the corner.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Have you noticed me before? All alone?
                            With every reason in the world to doubt?
                            Why won’t you talk to me?
                            My old friend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            You became popular, forgot about me.
                            Don’t you see everyday I’m crying?
                            It may be to you, but to me it’s not a game.
                            For I am just a kid with no name.

                                the night of
                                the rising dead they say, and the

                                 saw it move, spied

                                young boy sat in that old tree
                                his eyes red with bold fear, the
                                boy he said, “Why don’t you come here,”
                                <p>
                                </p>
                                the summer’s
                                cool breeze turned into blazing heat,
                                at that second I became
                                a soul, sent to a world not too great, a
                                world where the sun never shines and a chill
                                of lost and hidden memories
                                remain, and you know what, it was all the power of
                                that boy in the tree, all because of him,
                                <p>
                                </p>
                                I still go to that tree, I still
                                 see that scarecrow, I still incite,
                                I still fight, for I am unbinding
                                my wrecked heart, my torn mind, my
                                 last hope is the soul,
                                that differs from
                                him and I,
                                <p>

                                his
                                life is in vain and so is mine, “will
                                you sit with me,” he said, and many
                                times before I did, for years,
                                towards now, for I am only 12,
                                <p>
                                </p>
                                 after
                                so long it is only natural to be taken in, for that
                                is what happened on that night,
                                 only the full moon knows and can tell the
                                story, because the existence
                                of the boy and I, the tree and the scarecrow is a myth, the story of
                                the true me and of the true him,
                                <p>
                                </p>
                                even though only a few words can be fatal, still
                                he is mine and mine only, I’ll never forget the promises he makes
                                I’ll take the secret to my grave with me,
                                for I died of grave ill.

              I kept
              thinking, and my heart did the same by beating,
              on a fatal and
              unforgiven night, I stood with my heart beating,

              layed in a

              alone I would find myself across
              the road, I saw everything, as my
              only friend passed, his soul
              </p>
              <p>
              moves on, then
              I stand alone, as a
              man drew near, wrecked,
              my soul wanted to fly away with him, as the man held up his bloody plank

              he got closer he moved faster, all
              in the night of Christmas Eve, the
              boy was happy, to end up in the heavens
              above, we were
              not meant to end in a
              scary night, I’ve prayed to die happy in my sleep, and in the bell
              </p>
              <p>
              of time I
              slowly closed my eyes, dropped
              to the ground and sat down,
              my time wasn’t up and
               I knew that well, if I was closer down
               </p>

              the bad guy to save me again, a
              bad guy indeed, why are they in the world,
              I was an idiot to take sides with the man, an idiot to believe I could be with
              the boy too, I never would have chosen him if I had known, but I knew none.
